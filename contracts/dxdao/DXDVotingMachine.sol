 * @title GenesisProtocol implementation designed for DXdao
 *
 * New Features:
 *  - Payable Votes: Any organization can send funds and configure the gas and maxGasPrice to be refunded per vote.
 *  - Signed Votes: Votes can be signed for this or any voting machine, they can shared on this voting machine and
 *    execute votes signed for this voting machine.
 *  - Signal Votes: Voters can signal their decisions with near 50k gas, the signaled votes can be executed on
 *    chain by anyone.
